	<p style="color: black; text-align: center; font-family: Century Gothic; font-size: 17px;">I'm a young woman with big ambitions in the field of medical. These intentions, however, have been hampered because I moved my study focus to business and management up to this point. I have the constant desire to achieve my aspirations. I also want to study abroad in countries like Russia, the UK, and others. I have a strong curiosity about discovering and learning about the customs and cultures of all cultures.</p>

	<p style="color: black; text-align: center; font-family: Century Gothic; font-size: 17px;">Information management is my major of study at the university. Through this process of learning, I was able to become expert in using a variety of programmes, including Microsoft, Adobe, Sublime, and others. Furthermore, I have the confidence to speak in front of groups of people. In addition, I frequently engage in voluntary activities like aiding flood victims, assisting numerous clinics in the department to conduct Covid-19 exams, etc. I also frequently work "part-time" in a watch shop.</p>
